# Advanced-Computer-Science-AB-Project

Web app to help OHS students be more productive

First time coding in HTML/CSS/Javascript, learning how to build simple yet aesthetic applications

I built homepage, to do list, and about pages, Saim used fullCalendar and a plug in to build the rss newsfeed which I then integrated into the site

Reflection: Overall, I am quite happy with how this project turned out. I was able to apply my knowledge of data structures (arrays, maps, etc.) and definitely learned a lot about front and back end development. Moving forward, I hope to learn about these languages, and also about PHP and SQL so my website can actually store user information.

If I had to build this again, I would develop it further so that it can store user information so they can come back to their saved items in to do list and calendar. In addition, I would like to write more elegant code.  As I was racing towards a looming deadline, I did not have the time to make my code as elegant and documented as I would have liked. This actually gave me some difficulties as I frantically searched my code for bus, but it all worked out in the end.
